# These servers are for hosting with friends or publicly
probably messy but eh i just want to make a service that works **(even partially)**

**I am no professional so some things will seem a bit off but it works for the logging in and some things,**
**Still trying to figure out the buddy system and saving and sending buddylists, maybe use mysql? ðŸ¤”**

this project uses REDIS to save accounts and etc **(more to come)**
accounts can be banned by setting **banned** from 0(unbanned) to 1(banned)

yes even that exe is required to run in the same directory as the HeHeSPY.py file to decode passwords sent from the clients

is GPSP is going to be on a different server it will need a copy of the HeHeSPY.py file with it so it can use some things from it
but better to just have it all in one place.
